The data we'll be using is Open, High, Low, Close, Volume data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

For our purposes here, we're going to only be focused on the Close and Volume columns. What are these? The Close column measures the final price at the end of each interval. In this case, these are 1 minute intervals. So, at the end of each minute, what was the price of the asset.

The Volume column is how much of the asset was traded per each interval, in this case, per 1 minute.

In the simplest terms possible, Close is the price of the thing. Volume is how much of thing.
